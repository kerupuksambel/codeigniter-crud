# CodeIgniter CRUD
Pretty semantic title, this is a CRUD system and login system built with CI 3.

This CRUD system contains :
- Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Login and ~~Register~~
- AJAX Integration with BS Admin Template

## How to Use
1. Import the database file, that located in `assets/ci_crud.sql`
2. In the database config, set your database host, username, password, and name
3. In `index.php`, set the base link to your own.

P. S : I haven't make the registration system, so for now any user and password are inputted manually via PHPMyAdmin.
For now you can use username = `admin` and password = `123456`.

There are still more to come, btw.
